2. **Fixed** known bugs.
3. **Changed** the variable name from `clint` to `bot`.
4. **Added** slash commands.
5. **Added** a watching activity.

## Usage
To use this bot, download `main.py` and replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN` with your bot token. Don't forget to install `discord.py` using the following command:
